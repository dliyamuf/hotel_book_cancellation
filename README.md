## **DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE OF KNOWLEDGE**
Nowadays, travelers most significantly use internet to book hotel and make an reservation [1](https://doi.org/10.1177/1938965511418779). Hotel bookings represent a contract between customer and the hotel. The demand of hotel bookings can influence hotel's revenue, allocation, and budgets. Hence, search for factor of bookings cancellation can prevent revenue loss and get better marketing strategy [2](http://dx.doi.org/10.18089/tms.2017.13203).

## **BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING**
### **Problem Statement**
1. When is the most bookings cancellation date?
2. What is the major factor influence bookings cancellation?
3. How accurate is machine learning model can predict bookings cancellation? What is the best model?
### **Goals**
1. Identify most bookings cancellation date.
2. Analysis of bookings cancellation's influence factor.
3. Investigate accuration of machine learning models prediction of booking cancellation and choose the best model.
### **Solution statement**
1. Use correlation of arrival date and book cancellation data.
2. Explore features based on EDA, mutual information, and Pearson correlation?
3. Use 5 difference classification machine learning algorithm (Logistic Regresion, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost) with accuracy >95%. Algorithm selection is based on higher on accuracy and recall score.
